Hi there

this is a website I had the idea of producing, while I was volunteering in Cambodia for 7 months. 

They had an existing website (which was not very good) , and were paying a lot of money for the website hosting company, so I came up with the idea of making them one from scratch which would be free of cost.

However, in April I recieved other prioritisations which made this go on hold, and they decided they would prefer to keep their own website since they knew how to use it. (Sunken ship fallacy I would put it to)

So I've decided to finish it as a personal project, since I really like the idea and look of the website.
